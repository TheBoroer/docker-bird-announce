# The Kernel protocol is not a real routing protocol. Instead of communicating

# routing tables with the OS kernel.

#       export all;   # Actually insert routes into the kernel routing table
}

# The Device protocol is not a real routing protocol. It doesn't generate any
# routes and it only serves as a module for getting information about network
# interfaces from the kernel.
